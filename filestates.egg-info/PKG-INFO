# filestates

`filestates` is a Python package that allows you to manage the state of files and directories using YAML configuration files.

## Features

- **Apply and Modify Permissions and Ownership**: Manage file and directory permissions and ownership individually or recursively.
- **Create, Modify, and Delete Directories**: Use patterns and regex to create, modify, and delete directories and subdirectories (e.g., ensure each `Entity/MyEntity.php` file has a corresponding `Repository/MyEntityRepository.php`).
- **Create Files Using Templates and Placeholders**: Generate files from templates with dynamic placeholders.

## Installation

Install `filestates` with pip:

pip install filestates
